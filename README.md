# Automatic Speech Recognition

Automatic Speech Recognition Project which accepts one recording at a time, which is a sentence consisting of 4-10 digits that have been said with sufficiently long pause intervals.

The system splits the sentence and then recognizes each word.
A text with the recognized digits is generated at the output.
